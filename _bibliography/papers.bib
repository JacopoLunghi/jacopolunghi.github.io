  abstract={This study shows how soil aridity (proxied with a measure of soil potential evapotranspiration) impacts child wellbeing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using climate and infant health data from a grid of approximately 4,000 cells in 34 African countries, we find that infants born in arid areas are comparatively more likely to die under the age of 5 and be systematically underweight at birth. In addition, we show how the aridity measure in this study reduces the effect of rainfall on child wellbeing and how aridification drives substantial heterogeneity in the estimated response to increasing precipitation. The findings are combined with model projections of future climate conditions to emphasize the importance of accounting for aridity alongside precipitations when assessing the economic impact of climate.},

  title={"Yet it Rains. Aridification, Agriculture and Farmers’ Adaptation in Sub-Saharan Africa."},
  author={Lunghi, J. and Malpede, M. and Percoco, M.},
  abstract={Although the relationship between climate and agriculture has been extensively studied, the present study explores how the often-overlooked phenomenon of soil aridity (proxied with a measure of soil evapotranspiration) impacts agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate conditions and crop yield measures are collected over a grid of 0.5° x 0.5° for 32 African countries. We find that areas with higher soil aridity suffer from lower agricultural productivity. We document that those results are partly due to farmers' adaptation to changing climate conditions. Finally, we project how future climate conditions will affect agriculture in the African continent under different scenarios. The paper emphasizes the importance of accounting for aridity alongside precipitations when assessing the economic impact of climate change.

  title={"A Spreading Malaise: Manure Management, Air Pollution, and Hospital Admissions in Italy."},
  author={Lunghi, J.},
  abstract={Manure management is a widespread soil fertilization practice in agriculture. Yet, little is known about the environmental and health threats posed by manure application. I estimate the causal effect of manure spreading on fine particulate matter concentrations, as well as respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, mortality rate at discharge, and treatment costs using air quality and hospital discharge data from the Lombardy region in Italy. I exploit exogenous variation in spreading prohibitions to design a repeated event-study framework. I estimate an increase of around 27% in PM2.5 concentrations in the five days following a ban lift. I detect an increase in urgent hospitalizations, and higher hospital mortality rate during spreading events. Conversely, it is found no significant difference in the cost per hospitalization. Under these premises, I estimate the yearly financial burden of manure spreading to range between 17.22 and 37.14 million euros. Finally, I test the implications of a fully flexible regulatory framework to redistribute emissions over calendar days, which allows to reduce winter days in which PM exceeds hazard levels by 8%.

  title={"An assessment of the contribution of livestock intensity on particulate matter concentration in Italy."},
  author={Lunghi, J. and Malpede, M., and Reis, L.A.},
  abstract={The role of farming in influencing air pollution is widely recognized but lacking in causal evidence at an aggregate level. This paper uses a spatial econometric approach to estimate the impact of cattle and swine husbandry on ammonia and particulate matter concentration in Lombardy, respectively. The study finds a 1000-unit increase corresponding to roughly 1\% and 0.3\% respectively of the average livestock headcount per quadrant, increases daily levels of $NH_3$ and $PM_{10}$ levels by 0.26 to 0.41 $\mu g/m^3$ for cattle, around 2\% and 1\% of respective average daily concentrations, and 0.01 to 0.04 $\mu g/m^3$ for swines. The estimated impact is robust to distance weighting and appears stronger with North upwind patterns, which reduces the probability of coexisting pollution sources. The results inform the potential impact of changing livestock intensity in Lombardy.
