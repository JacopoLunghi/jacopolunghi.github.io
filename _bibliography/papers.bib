  abstract={This study shows how soil aridity (proxied with a measure of soil potential evapotranspiration) impacts child wellbeing in Sub-Saharan Africa. Using climate and infant health data from a grid of approximately 4,000 cells in 34 African countries, we find that infants born in arid areas are comparatively more likely to die under the age of 5 and be systematically underweight at birth. In addition, we show how the aridity measure in this study reduces the effect of rainfall on child wellbeing and how aridification drives substantial heterogeneity in the estimated response to increasing precipitation. The findings are combined with model projections of future climate conditions to emphasize the importance of accounting for aridity alongside precipitations when assessing the economic impact of climate.},

  abstract={Although the relationship between climate and agriculture has been extensively studied, the present study explores how the often-overlooked phenomenon of soil aridity (proxied with a measure of soil evapotranspiration) impacts agricultural productivity in Sub-Saharan Africa. Climate conditions and crop yield measures are collected over a grid of 0.5° x 0.5° for 32 African countries. We find that areas with higher soil aridity suffer from lower agricultural productivity. We document that those results are partly due to farmers' adaptation to changing climate conditions. Finally, we project how future climate conditions will affect agriculture in the African continent under different scenarios. The paper emphasizes the importance of accounting for aridity alongside precipitations when assessing the economic impact of climate change.},

  title={"Exploring the impact of livestock on air quality: A deep dive into Ammonia and particulate matter in Lombardy."},
  author={Lunghi, J. and Malpede, M., and Reis, L.A.},
  abstract={The linkage between agricultural activities, particularly livestock farming, and atmospheric pollution is broadly acknowledged and its magnitude is widely analyzed. Lombardy, one of Europe's most critical areas with regard to air pollution, has significantly large contributions from the farming industry. Although studies aimed at informing policy reflect uncertain and moderate pollution reduction even under simulated stringent policy scenarios, granular causal evidence at a sub-sector level remains insufficient to inform local and regional policies effectively. In this study, we employ spatial econometrics to investigate the specific impact of bovine and swine farming on the concentration levels of ammonia (NH3) and coarse particulate matter (PM10) in Lombardy's atmosphere. Our findings indicate that an increase of 1000 units in livestock—equating to roughly a 1\% and 0.3\% rise in the average per-quadrant bovine and swine populations respectively—triggers a corresponding daily increase in NH3 and PM10 concentrations. These increases are quantified as 0.26 [0.22; 0.33] and 0.29 [0.27; 0.41] $\mu g/m3$ for bovines (about 2% and 1% of the respective daily averages) and 0.01 [0.01; 0.05] and 0.04 [0.004; 0.16] $\mu g/m3$ for swine. Notably, these impacts are intensified under northerly upwind conditions, minimizing the potential for concurrent pollution sources and reinforcing the robustness of our estimated impacts. Finally, we employ our findings to extrapolate the potential environmental implications of reducing livestock emissions. Our analysis suggests that bovine and swine farming could account for up to 20\% of local pollution exposure, empathizing the need for targeted mitigation strategies.},

  title={"A Spreading Malaise: Manure Management, Air Pollution, and Hospital Admissions in Italy."},
  author={Lunghi, J.},
  abstract={Manure management is a widespread soil fertilization practice in agriculture. Yet, little is known about the environmental and health threats posed by manure application. I estimate the causal effect of manure spreading on fine particulate matter concentrations, as well as respiratory and cardiovascular hospitalizations, mortality rate at discharge, and treatment costs using air quality and hospital discharge data from the Lombardy region in Italy. I exploit exogenous variation in spreading prohibitions to design a repeated event-study framework. I estimate an increase of around 27% in PM2.5 concentrations in the five days following a ban lift. I detect an increase in urgent hospitalizations, and higher hospital mortality rate during spreading events. Conversely, it is found no significant difference in the cost per hospitalization. Under these premises, I estimate the yearly financial burden of manure spreading to range between 17.22 and 37.14 million euros. Finally, I test the implications of a fully flexible regulatory framework to redistribute emissions over calendar days, which allows to reduce winter days in which PM exceeds hazard levels by 8%.
