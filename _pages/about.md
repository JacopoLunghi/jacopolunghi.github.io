*Welcome to my webpage!*

I am a Post Doc at the CMCC European Institute on Economics and the Environment. I hold a Ph.D. in Economics at Bocconi University, and a M.Sc. in Applied Economic Analysis from Stockholm School of Economics.

My research interests include environmental economics, health economics, climate change, economic development, and migration studies.

Currently based in Milan.
