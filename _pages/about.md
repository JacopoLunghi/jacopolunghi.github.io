I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at Bocconi University, and a Visting Researcher at RFF-CMCC European Institute of Environmental Economics. I hold a M.Sc. in Applied Economic Analysis from Stockholm School of Economics. Last year, I have been a Visiting Graduate at University of California San Diego.

My research interests include environmental economics, health economics, economic development, and migration studies.



Currently based in Milan.
